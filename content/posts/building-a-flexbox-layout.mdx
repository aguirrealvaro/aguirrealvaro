Almost every web page consists of a header, a main section, and a footer. In this short guide, we will explore how to build a layout where the main section automatically occupies the available space using flexbox.

Based on a simple HTML structure

```html title="index.html"
<body>
    <header>navbar</header>
    <main>main</main>
    <footer>footer</footer>
</body>
```

We will apply the following styles

```css title="styles.css"
body {
  min-height: 100dvh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

main {
  flex: 1;
}
```

We use `min-height: 100dvh;` so that the body takes the entire height of the viewport, which changes as the browser UI expands or contracts.
This is a new unit that replace `100vh` which fix the height for mobile heights.

When setting `flex-direction: column` on the body, the elements stack vertically. For main, we will apply `flex: 1`, which means it will automatically occupy all the remaining available space in the column after space has been allocated to other elements, such as the `header` and `footer`.

Getting:

 <Image
    src="/layout.png"
    alt="layout-picture"
    width={869}
    height={563}
/>

Note: I added additional styles for illustrative purposes only.

There are other alternatives, where, for example, the height of main is set to 100vh - (header height + footer height), but it is a more complex solution as it requires calculations. Additionally, using flexbox is simpler and more scalable.
